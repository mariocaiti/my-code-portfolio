Welcome to Visualize It, a basic calculator that takes your weekly income and helps you plan your budget for both immediate 
needs and long-term fun.
<br>
It's pay what you want, because you're obviously using this because you're broke :p but we hope you'll pay something. Details 
follow at the end of your calculation run.<br>
