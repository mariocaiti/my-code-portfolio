<b>What's here?!</b></center><br>
Featured: The Front End Javascript demo has some apps utilitizing React Native (scroll down!) and Python using Flask. There is also a folder showing the demo using Angular JS.<br> 
The other files are older, from the days of perl and Actionscript (RIP to both).<br>
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.<br>
I hope you like my work.
