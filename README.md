<b>What's here?!</b></center><br>
Featured: The React Native and Angular JS demos are the most up to date. On the front page, there is the same app demonstrated with Python using the Flask library.<br> 
The other files are older, from the days of perl and Actionscript (RIP to both). "JScript Animation" shows a fully functional animation using the DOM Canvas.<br>
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.<br>
I hope you like my work.
