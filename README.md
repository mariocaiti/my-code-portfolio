<center><h3>My 2021 portfolio</h3><br>
<b>What's here?!</b></center><br>
NEW: The React Native and Flutter folders are the most relevant. The future is mobile. I included just main files for a variety of diverse apps.<br>
On the front page, there is also code for a Python version of an app I did using the Flask library. I have some apps that I remake to learn different languages.<br> 
"JScript Animation" shows a fully functional animation using the DOM Canvas. "Front End Javascript" also has the workings of an app in Javascript. "Goof Off Timer" is a Chrome plugin that is unfinished. It happens.<br>
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.<br>
I hope you like my work.
