=================

My 2020 portfolio: 
What's here?!
The most current folders are Front End Javascript (D3) and React Native. There's also a Python with Flask server demo up front. 
The other files are older, from the days of perl and Actionscript (RIP to both).
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.
I hope you like my work.
