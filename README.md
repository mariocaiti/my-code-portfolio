=================

My 2020 portfolio:<br>
What's here?!<br>
The most current folders are Front End Javascript (D3) and React Native. There's also a Python with Flask server demo up front.<br> 
The other files are older, from the days of perl and Actionscript (RIP to both).<br>
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.<br>
I hope you like my work.
