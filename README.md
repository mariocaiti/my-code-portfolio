<center><h3>My 2020 portfolio</h3><br>
<b>What's here?!</b></center><br>
The most current folders are AngularJS, Front End Javascript (D3), and React Native. There's also a Python with Flask server demo on the front menu, not foldered.<br> 
The other files are older, from the days of perl and Actionscript (RIP to both).<br>
I currently work with Flutter+Dart for apps, WebAssembly (rust or go) for sites, and Arduino for non-web things.<br>
I hope you like my work.
